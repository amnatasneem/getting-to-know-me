        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
        <h3 id="intropara">My full name is Amna Tasneem. I am a junior majoring in Computer Science with a concentration
            in Cybersecurity.
            I transferred to Lewis University from Benedictine University in August of 2022. I currently live with my
            mom, dad, brother, and pet cat.
            My brother is 24 years old - he works at Medline as an Associate Product Manager.
            My dad works as a Performance Testing Engineer at SoftRams, and my mom as an Assistant Teacher at Gregory
            Middle School.
            My cat does not work. She is unemployed and lives off of the money I painstakingly earn at my part time
            jobs. This is her:

        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
            <li>thoroughly identify use cases</li>
            <li>find security issues before deploying my code</li>

    <div id="hobby">
        <h2>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</h2>
        <p style="text-indent:30px;"> A recent activity I picked up is strength training.
            I started mid-July and have been consistent since.
            My gym split has changed a few times since I have started as a result of doing my best to fit the workouts
            into my schedule as well as what muscle groups I want to target.
            I learned that strength training is an activity that not just takes place in the gym, but also outside of
            it.
            The way I shop for groceries is different as I know keep an eye out for protein content. When I first
            started strength training,
            I was bulking, however, I personally did not enjoy the food comas, brain fog, tendency to be lazy, and self
            body image criticism that came with it.
            Ever since then, I have been doing my best to eat lean protein and to also maintain a holistically
            nutritious diet.
            Changes that I had to make in my daily lifestyle is to have the dedication to consistent, confident, buy
            nutritous food (which tends to be pricier, but Aldi has been a lifesaver!), eat the right amount of protein,
            track calories (to shed the bulk weight), wake up early to hit the gym before it gets busy, and much more.

        <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
        <p style="text-indent:30px;">A fun fact about me is that when I was a senior in highschool, looking for cars for
            sale online, I genuinely thought that the Kia Soul 2020 in the color yellow was the coolest car.
            I went to the dealership with my family to buy it, but fortunately, they didn't have the yellow one.
            I get first hand embarrassment looking back at my bad taste.
            I ended up getting the Kia Forte in red, but that's only because every other car was too expensive, not
            because my taste is still bad.
            I'm glad I didn't end up getting the hamster car.</p>
